//PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:

in C++, there are 5 types of data types (roughly):
int
    (takes 4 bytes space, stores integers)
char
    (takes 1 byte space, stores single character)
float 
    (take 4 bytes space, stores float numbers)
bool   
    (takes 1 byte, space either true or false) 
    // unlike python it has small t & f in true and false respectively
    cout == either 0 or 1 . 0 for false; 1 for true.
double
    (takes 8 bytes (the double of floats))
    by default, the doubles are the first taken in code
    unless on mentions F or f at the end of the value.
